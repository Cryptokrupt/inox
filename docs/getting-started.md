# Getting started

After you have [installed Inox](https://github.com/inoxlang/inox/blob/master/README.md#installation) open a terminal and run:
```
$ inox shell
```

This will open the **Inox REPL**, it allows you to interactively evaluate Inox code & run Inox scripts. You can learn more [here](https://github.com/inoxlang/inox/blob/master/docs/shell-starter.md).\
The `quit` command stops the REPL.

## IDE

Open a terminal and execute the following command:
```
inox run ide/idex.ix
```

This will start an IDE on https://localhost:1200, it is not very stable so feel free to Ctrl+C & restart the IDE if it stopped working.

## Learning the language

The basics of the language are explained in this [file](./language-basics.md).\
You can also explore the `examples/` folder and start with scripts in `examples/basic`.\
After you learned the basics you can go in the `docs/features` folder and pick the feature you want to explore !
