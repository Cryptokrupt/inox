### Injection Prevention (WIP)

In Inox interpolations are always restricted in order to prevent **injections** and regular strings are **never trusted**.
URLs & paths are first-class values and must be used to perform network or filesystem operations. 

#### **URL Interpolations**

When you dynamically create URLs the interpolations are restricted based on their location (path, query).\

Let's say that you are writing a piece of code that fetches **public** data from a private/internal service and returns the result 
to a user. You are using the query parameter `?admin=false` in the URL because only public data should be returned.
```
public_data = http.read!(https://private-service{path}?admin=false)
```

The way in which the user interacts with your code is not important here, let's assume that the user can send any value for `path`.
Obviously this is a very bad idea from a security standpoint.
A malicious path could be used to:
- perform a directory traversal if the private service has a vulnerable endpoint
- inject a query parameter `?admin=true` to retrieve private data
- inject a port number

In Inox the URL interpolations are special, based on the location of the interpolation specific checks are performed:

```
https://example.com/api/{path}/?x={x}
```

- interpolations before the **'?'** are **path** interpolations
  - the strings/characters **..** | **\*** | **\\** | **?** | **#** are forbidden
  - **':'** is forbidden at the start of the finalized path (after all interpolations have been evaluated)
- interpolations after the **'?'** are **query** interpolations 
  - the characters **'&'** and **'#'** are forbidden

In the example if the path `/data?admin=true` is received the Inox runtime will throw an error:
```
URL expression: result of a path interpolation should not contain any of the following substrings: "..", "\" , "*", "?"
```

#### **Checked Strings (SQL..)**

<!-- code that appear in the image
> path="/data?admin=true"
> public_data=read!(https://private-service{path}?admin=false
URL expression: result of a path interpolation should not contain any of the following substrings: "..", "\" , "*", "?"'>
-->

Checked strings are strings that are validated against a pattern. When you dynamically
create a checked string all the interpolations must be explicitly **typed**.

<img src="./docs/img/query-injection.png"></img>

<!-- code that appear in the image
> id = "1 or 1=1"
> query=%sql.query`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {{int:id}}`
runtime check error: 0 or 1=1 does not match %sql.int
-->

### Permission System

#### **Required Permissions** 

Inox features a fine-grained **permission system** that restricts what a module is allowed to do, here are a few examples of permissions:
- access to the filesystem (read, create, update, write, delete)
- access to the network (several distinct permissions)
    - HTTP (read, create, update, delete, listen)
    - Websocket (read, write, listen)
    - DNS (read)
    - Raw TCP (read, write)
- access to environment variables (read, write, delete)
- create coroutines (multi threading)
- execute specific commands

Inox modules always start with a **manifest** that describes the required permissions.

<img src="./docs/img/fs-malicious-input.png"></img>

<!-- code that appear on the image
manifest {
  permissions: {
    read: %/tmp/...
  }
}

malicious_user_input = /home/
....
print(fs.ls!(malicious_user_input))

-->

When a forbidden operation is performed the module panics with an error:\
`core: error: not allowed, missing permission: [read path(s) /home/]`

#### **Isolation of Dependencies**

In imports the importing module specifies the permissions it **grants** to the imported module.

`./app.ix`

```
manifest {
  permissions: {
    read: %/...
    create: {routines: {}}
  }
}

import lib ./malicious-lib.ix {
  arguments: {}
  allow: {
    read: %/tmp/...
  }
}
```

`./malicious-lib.ix`

```
manifest {
  permissions: {
    read: %/...
  }
}

data = fs.read!(/etc/passwd)
```

If the imported module ask more permissions than granted an error is thrown:\
`import: some permissions in the imported module's manifest are not granted: [read path(s) /...] `

#### **Dropping Permissions**

Sometimes programs have an **initialization** phase, for example a program reads a file or performs an HTTP request to fetch its configuration.
After this phase it no longer needs some permissions so it can drop them.

```
drop-perms {
  read: %https://**
}
```

### DoS Mitigation

#### **Limitations (WIP)**

Limitations limit the **speed** at which some actions are performed, the minimum required values/rates are specified in the manifest.
This feature is still in development and will be fully implemented soon.\
Limitations will for example allow the developer to **restrict** the share of disk/network bandwidth allocated to a http request handler.

```
manifest {
    permissions: {
        ...
    }
    limits: {
        "fs/read": 10MB/s
        "http/req": 10x/s
    }
}
```

### Sensitive Data Protection (WIP)

#### **Secrets**

Secrets are special Inox values, they can only be created by defining an **environment variable** with a pattern like %secret-string.
- The content is **hidden** when printed or logged
- Secrets are not serializable, so you **cannot** send them over the network
- A comparison involving a secret always returns **false**

```
manifest {
    ...
    env: %{
        API_KEY: %secret-string
    }
    ...
}

API_KEY = env.initial.API_KEY
```


#### **Visibility (WIP)**

TODO: explain


### Declaration of CLI Parameters & Environment Variables

CLI parameters & environment variables can be described in the manifest:

```
manifest {
    parameters: {
        # positional parameters are listed at the start
        {
            name: #dir
            pattern: %path
            rest: false
            description: "root directory of the project"
        }
        # non positional parameters
        clean-existing: {
            pattern: %bool
            default: false
            description: "if true delete <dir> if it already exists"
        }
    }
    env: {
      API_KEY: %secret-string
    }

    permissions: {
        write: IWD_PREFIX # initial working directory
        delete: IWD_PREFIX
    }
}

# {
#   "dir": ...
#   "clean-existing": ...
# }
args = mod-args

API_KEY = env.initial.API_KEY
```

#### Help Message Generation

```
$ inox run test.ix 
not enough CLI arguments
usage: <dir path> [--clean-existing]

required:

  dir: %path
      root directory of the project

options:

  clean-existing (--clean-existing): boolean
      if true delete <dir> if it already exists
```

#### **Simplified Resource Manipulation**

- The builtin [**read**](./docs/shell-basics.md#read) function can read directories / files / HTTP resources and parse their content.
```
read ./
# output: 
[
  dir/
  file.txt 1kB 
]

read ./file.txt
# output: 
hello

read ./file.json
# output: 
{"key": "value"}

read https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1
# output: 
{
  "body": "quia et suscipit\nsuscipit recusandae consequuntur expedita....", 
  "id": 1.0, 
  "title": "sunt aut facere repellat provident occaecati excepturi optio reprehenderit", 
  "userId": 1.0
}
```

- The builtin [**create**](./docs/shell-basics.md#create) function can create directories / files / HTTP resources.
```
create ./dir/
create ./file.txt "hello world !"
create https://example.com/posts tojson({title: "hello"})
```

### Built-in Browser Automation

```
h = chrome.Handle!()

h.nav https://go.dev/
node = h.html_node!(".Hero-blurb")
h.close()
```

[Documentation](https://github.com/inoxlang/inox/blob/master/docs/builtin.md#browser-automation)

[Examples](https://github.com/inoxlang/inox/tree/master/examples/chrome)

### Transactions & Effects (WIP)

Inox allows you to attach a **transaction** to the current execution context (think SQL transactions).
When a **side effect** happens it is recorded in the transaction. If the execution is cancelled for whatever reason the transaction is automatically **rollbacked** and reversible effects are reversed. (A mode that causes side effects to only be committed if the transaction succeed is also planned).

```
tx = start_tx()

# effect
fs.mkfile ./file.txt 

# rollback transaction --> delete ./file.txt
cancel_exec() 
```


### Concurrency

#### **Coroutines (Goroutines)**

```
coroutine = go {globals: .{print}} do {
  print("hello from goroutine !")
  return 1
}

# 1
result = coroutine.wait_result!()
```

#### **Coroutine Groups**

```
group = RoutineGroup()
coroutine1 = go {group: group} do read!(https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1)
coroutine2 = go {group: group} do read!(https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/2)

results = group.wait_results!()
```

#### **Lifetime Jobs**

Lifetime jobs are coroutines linked to an object.

```
object = {
  lifetimejob #handle-messages {
    for msg in watch_received_messages(self){
      # handle messages
    }
  }
}
```


### Built-in Functions

Inox comes with many built-in functions for:
- browser automation
- file manipulation
- HTTP resource manipulation 
- data container constructors (Graph, Tree, ...)

**[List of Built-in Functions](./docs/builtin.md)**

### Communication

In Inox objects can communicate in several different ways.

#### **Message Sending**

The `sendval` construct allows an object to send message to another object.

```
object = {
  inner: {
    method: fn(){
      # supersys is a keyword that designates the parent object here 
      sendval "hello" to supersys
    }
  }
  
  lifetimejob #handle-messages {
    for msg in watch_received_messages(self){
      print(msg) # "hello"
    }
   }
}
```
