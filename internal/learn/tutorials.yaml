      # There are two kinds of variables: globals & locals.
      # Local variables are declared with the `var` keyword or with an assignment.
      var local1 = 1
      
      # Assigning a local that is not declared is equivalent to declaring it.
      local2 = 2
      
      # Variable declarations can have a type annotation.
      # Replace `0` with `string` to see what happens.
      var i int = 0

      # Global variable declaration
      globalvar global1 = 1

      # Assigning a global that is not declared is equivalent to declaring it.
      $$global2 = 2
      
      # Global variables cannot be shadowed by local variables.
      # var global1 = 3

      print("local1 =", local1, "global1 =", global1)
    output:
    - "local1 = 1 global1 = 1"
