# Security Policy

**After the version 0.1 is released I will undertake a major cleanup of the codebase and improve tests, so for now only report critical vulnerabilities. Thanks !**


Being *Secure by default* is one of the main goal of the Inox project. Security issues will be addressed as soon as possible.
If you think you have found a vulnerability please **report** it.
