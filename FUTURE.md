## Planned Features

- Version Control System for Inox projects:
    - Git subset with storage in S3 Buckets and Git-compatible services (Github, Gitlab).
    - Simplified VCS for non-professional developers.
- Teams
    - creation & management of members
    - access control
- Improved Database
    - smart pre-fetching and caching
    - (short term) ability to store hundreds of gigabytes of data
    - (long term)  ability to store terabytes of data 
- Monitoring with persistence in S3.
- Log persistence in S3.
- Limited IaaC (infrastructure as code) capabilities:
    - VM provisioning
    - S3 Bucket creation
    - CDN configuration
- Cluster management using only the **inox** binary (small scale only)
- WebAssembly support using https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero.
- Internal plugin system or hooks (Inox |Â WASM)
